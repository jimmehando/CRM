Travel Insurance
Cooling Off Period
This policy can be cancelled within 21 days of the date of
issue for a full refund of the entire premium unless the
customer has made or needs to make a claim under the
policy or has already departed on their journey.
General Terms and Conditions
We believe it is important for you to consider taking out
appropriate travel insurance to cover your travel
arrangements. Insurance cover offered by credit card
companies or reciprocal medical cover agreements may
not be comprehensive or suit your needs – we
recommend you carefully check the cover and benefits
and consider whether it is necessary to purchase
additional travel insurance. Insurance that covers various
aspects of your travel, such as cancellation, overseas
medical and repatriation expenses, personal injury and
accident, death, loss of personal baggage and money,
and personal liability can be beneficial.
Travel insurance is strongly recommended by the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for all travel.
Your travel consultant can provide general information to
you about travel insurance. For details of the services
that travel insurers provide, including a quote, please
refer to the travel insurer's Combined Financial Services
