Essential Information
Passports & Visas
It is your responsibility when travelling or transiting on your journey to ensure that you have valid passports,
visas, ESTA ( USA), eTA (Canada, New Zealand, and The United Kingdom are some countries allowing travel
via eTAs for Australian passport holders) and re-entry permits which meet the requirements of immigration
and other government authorities. If you need information regarding visas and other travel document
requirements (i.e. ESTA or eTA eligibility) for your trip, please ask your travel consultant for assistance.
Please note that many destinations require a minimum of 6 month's passport validity from return date.
Please let us know if you have less than 6 months validity on your passport and we can confirm requirements
specific to your travel arrangements.
Many countries require passport information to be included in itineraries prior to travel. We want your travel
experience to be as smooth as possible and request that passports for all travellers be presented to your
consultant prior to departure.
Visa Advice
Visa Not Required
Important Information
7 / 12 
Some countries allow Australian passport holders to enter without a visa for a limited time. Each
destination has its own rules, so it’s best to check the CIBT website or contact the country’s consulate
directly to confirm the details.
For most countries the traveller must:
· Hold a passport valid at least six months beyond the period of intended stay with one blank visa page
· Hold proof of sufficient funds
· Hold proof of confirmed onward/return airline tickets
· Hold documents showing proof of purpose of trip
· Hold all documents required for the next destination
· Hold a visa for the next country, where applicable
· Confirm with their airline that boarding will be permitted without a visa as these conditions are subject
to change
If you don’t meet the eligibility criteria, you may need to obtain a visa before departure. It is your
responsibility to confirm these details as early as possible.
Visa and passport rules can change, so please reconfirm requirements closer to departure via the link
above or with your travel consultant.
Many countries require at least 6 months’ passport validity from your return date. If your passport has
less than 6 months’ validity, let us know so we can advise accordingly.
Non-Australian passport holders may have additional re-entry requirements. Dual passport holders or
those using travel documents must also check for any extra visa conditions and notify us promptly.
Booking Note 13 Sep 2025
This information is for Australian passport holders traveling to Japan for Tourism purposes:
Visa Exempt

Hold a passport valid at least six months on entry with two blank visa pages

Travel Insurance
Cooling Off Period
This policy can be cancelled within 21 days of the date of
issue for a full refund of the entire premium unless the
customer has made or needs to make a claim under the
policy or has already departed on their journey.
General Terms and Conditions
We believe it is important for you to consider taking out
appropriate travel insurance to cover your travel
arrangements. Insurance cover offered by credit card
companies or reciprocal medical cover agreements may
not be comprehensive or suit your needs – we
recommend you carefully check the cover and benefits
and consider whether it is necessary to purchase
additional travel insurance. Insurance that covers various
aspects of your travel, such as cancellation, overseas
medical and repatriation expenses, personal injury and
accident, death, loss of personal baggage and money,
and personal liability can be beneficial.
Travel insurance is strongly recommended by the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for all travel.
Your travel consultant can provide general information to
you about travel insurance. For details of the services
that travel insurers provide, including a quote, please
refer to the travel insurer's Combined Financial Services

FSG/PDS") and Target Market Determination ("TMD").
